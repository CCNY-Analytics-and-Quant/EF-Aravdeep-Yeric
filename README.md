Step 3: Calculate the mean, variance, and correlation matrix for all assets
Step 4: Calculate efficient frontier and optimal weights for your portfolio (Donâ€™t forget the output!)
Step 5: Use MatPlotLib or Seaborn libraries to graph the results (matrix and frontier)
Step 6: Output the calculated optimal weighting (identify portfolio weightings for optimum Sharpe Ratio)
along with the efficient frontier and correlation matrix charts. Output to a saved file.
